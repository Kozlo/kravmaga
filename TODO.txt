(DONE)- add lessons to the profile
 (DONE)- list of lessons for my user
 (DONE)- ability to select if going
(DONE)- make it possible to add/remove attendees to lessons
- restyle the profile page
- add proper validation to form fields (use react validate module)
- switch to webpack and add hot module re-load

- check if there are no double dependencies and see if they can be removed (like bootstrap, so react-bootstrap is used only
- add filters and limits to user (and other lists)
- consider looping through the form control and creating them dynamically instead of having separate entries

- optionally add the PUT method as well, but make sure it works as expected
- Add JSDoc to components (research this a bit as well)

Bugs:
- when the user reloads the page and turns out he is blocked, 2 error messages are shown (from navbar and profile page requests)

-----------------------------------------------
Later
- when deleting a user, should also remove his ID from groups and lessons
- research about auth0 and JWT, should the token be automatically refreshed after a while if the user is active?
- read on node.js/Express security and consider adding https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet
- add and use Node Security Project on the proejct https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/ ALDO snyk (checks and fixes issues in your codebase)
- limit how long input can be (e.g. no 100+ char long emails)
  - maybe check mongoose/mongodb defaults
- check what algo crypto is using and see if can be updated if SHA1 (unsecure)
- add CSRF protection: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- test and add brute force protection to authentication: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- add es-list rules, based on air-bnb rules: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#properties
- adda 404 page for the API
- add 'loading' state instead of just disabling the button: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#buttons-loading
- for admin panel in actions use: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#btn-groups-toolbar
- split up utils code into separate files
- research dependencies. maybe I don't nee both react and react-dom
- add a 'PUT' handler
- consider lazy loading for components to reduce initial JS file size
- when done with phase 1, read on releases and make it a major release
