(DONE)- Add base app (based on the tutorial)
(DONE)- upgrade to React 15.3
(DONE)- Create some login store where the authentication state changes. then subscribe in components to reflect the changes
(DONE)- create a home page
  (DONE)- add Auth0 integration on home page
  (DONE)- do the necessary navbar changes (e.g. welcome, name) and the necessary route displaying
  (DONE)- commit the auht0 switch to bower that fixed double react include bug
  (DONE)- figure out the setState error on logout: switched to alt's getStores & getPropsFromStores static methods

- Add proper back-end authentication:
  - enable FB/Google logins
    (DONE)- enable and configure on Auth0
    - see what data can be retrieved here (email, picture, location, birthdate, gender etc.)
      - Google: email, picture, gender, birthdate, country
      - Facebook: email, user_birthday, location, first_name?, last_name?
  - need to create a route for profile:
    - if the user exists, then login with authstore
    - if the user doesn't exist in the DB, should create it (and then login):
      - consider only allowing vertified e-mail addresses (but maybe not, as it might be annoying... should research)
      - required field(s): probably base this on authId (not e-mail, as it can change, but still keep it unique in the DB)
        - figure out which one I should use: user_id, clientID, global_client_id (these also apply to FB, Google)
          - check if client_ID and global ID are the same for all sing-up versions
        (DONE)- check if there's an authID if the user is using Google/FB
          - yes, but it has either 'facebook' or 'google-oauth2' in front of it
      - optional fields:
        - all info that can be retrieved from Google/FB, or just authId and e-mail otherwise
    - should show some message if the user was created (login is there already in AuthStore)

- Create profile page (as index page) that the user is redirected to
  - do the necessary back-end changes (need to save the user the DB and link auth0 account with other info)
    (DONE)- add JWT JWT auth to back-end
    -
    - need to create code on profile page to retrieve profile info

- Add JSDoc to components (research this a bit as well)


Later
- check out react bootstarp and how to use it... and if I'm using ir correctly
- play around with the styles (currently using the one from the tutorial)
- check out Auth0 to see if it's possible to replace the popup with a regular form
- check out Auth0 to see what other options there are (e.g. faster popup animation, custom fields, language etc.)
- make a better footer
- add active styles for links in navbar
- figure out if it's possible to not show the login page if the user is to be redirected
- add Latvian language to Auht0
- add other logon options (FB, Google+ etc.)
- Read on SPA routing/navigation logic best practices and (DONE) amend routing/navbar accordingly
- add login with FB option (currently only Google)
- should test routes for profile info, maybe need to logout user if authorization isn't fine on server
