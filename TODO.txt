(DONE)- Lessons (ADMIN):
  (DONE)- Need to see a list of users as attendees
    (DONE)- probably make something similar to group members
  (DONE)- need a select with users so that they can be added to the attendee list (just like for groups)
  (DONE)- should also have some sort of a separate list of attendees (maybe skipping the first thing)
  (DONE)- BUG: when the array is empty on update, the property is removed from the POST. might need to pass some empty value and remove it on the API

(DONE/SKIP)- Lessons (USER):
  (DONE)- A user cannot mark attendance after the lesson start date
  - When pressing 'busu' it is shown whether the user has payed subscription/lesson
    - NEED TO DISCUSS. maybe if a subscription is valid then all is good, otherwise check if unused lessons are available.. but need to consider this thoroughtly
  - need a list of lessons where a user has attended, but not payed
      - DISCUSS, might be too tricky

(DONE)- Users (admin)
  (DONE)- introduce a new admin field: lesson attendance count
  (DONE)- when clicking attending/not attending the count of lessons a user has attended should be updated accordingly
  (DONE)- also need to update when the admin adds/removes attendees

- Check the database warning from mongolab (might need to update some dependencies)

- Switch to Monday as the week start date

BUGS:
(DONE)- when updating a payment the payment type is changed to 'other'
(DONE)- when editing payment type, the 'has usage' checkbox is not selected if ti should be
- when selecting users for a lesson the user list has all users, not only the ones in the selected group
- after upgrade: Warning: Modal: isMounted is deprecated. Instead, make sure to clean up subscriptions and pending requests in componentWillUnmount to prevent memory leaks.
- make sure there are not so many warnings
- Check deployment database size


- research how to allow one email for several users
  - need to make a different unique key (username - could be email as well by default)
  - need to make a script for updating the data (i.e. copy emails to be username)
  - need to make a backup of the database first!!! (at least user data)

- consider saving the profile pictures instead of links as e.g. Facebook links expire
  - need to resize the image to make it really small
  - need to test how much size does the image take

-----------------------------------------------
Later
- consider switching to a typeahead for location selector https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead
- make changes to mobile version (datetime picker is hard to use)
- switch to webpack and add hot module re-load
- check what algo crypto is using and see if can be updated if SHA1 (unsecure)
- add CSRF protection: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- test and add brute force protection to authentication: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- add es-list rules, based on air-bnb rules: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#properties
- adda 404 page for the API
- add 'loading' state instead of just disabling the button: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#buttons-loading
- for admin panel in actions use: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#btn-groups-toolbar
- split up utils code into separate files
- consider lazy loading for components to reduce initial JS file size
