- Switch to Monday as the week start date

(DONE)- Make pre-defined payment types section:
  - Name (Nosaukums)
  - Payment amount (Daudzums (EUR))
  - Has lesson count (Ir reižu skaita ierobežojums)

(DONE)- Payments section (ADMIN):
  - Name Surname (email) [a link to profile]
  - Date when payed (the default is today)
  - Payment type (probably this simply pre-fils the amount that the use can change), probably store these value in the store
  - Amount
  - Valid From (by default today)
  - Valid To (by default a month from now)
  - IF the payment type has 'uses':
    - Total lessons
    - Used lessons

BUGS:
- CHECK if there are any dates that need to have hours set to 0 (just as for the lessons)
- make sure the previously added fonts are added to the CSS as well
- CHECK if bootstrap styles are not being overwritten (react boostrap looks different by default so could be I don't need to import it separately)

(DONE)- add filter to the admin panel for payments

- Check deployment database size

Other Payment-related tasks:
  - add valid from/to date validation (copy from lessons):
    - BE
    - FE
  - when deleting a user, their payments are deleted as well
  - when adding/modifying/deleting a user, update the payment store users asd well

- Payments section (USER):
  - a list of read-only active/payed lessons (i.e. expiry < current date)
    - payment date
    - payment type
    - amount
    - valid from
    - valid to
    - IF the payment has uses:
      - total lesson count
      - used lesson count

- Lessons (USER):
  - A user cannot mark attendance after the lesson start date
  - When pressing 'busu' it is shown whether the user has payed subscription/lesson
    - NEED TO DISCUSS. maybe if a subscription is valid then all is good, otherwise check if unused lessons are available.. but need to consider this thoroughtly

- Lessons (ADMIN):
  - Need to see a list of users as attendees
    - probably make something similar to group members
    - should also have some sort of a separate list of attendees (maybe skipping the first thing)
  - need a list of lessons where a user has attended, but not payed
    - DISCUSS

- Users (admin)
  - introduce a new admin field: lesson attendance count
  - when clicking attending/not attending the count of lessons a user has attended should be updated accordingly

- make changes to mobile version (datetime picker is hard to use)
- switch to webpack and add hot module re-load
- check what algo crypto is using and see if can be updated if SHA1 (unsecure)
- add CSRF protection: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- test and add brute force protection to authentication: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- add es-list rules, based on air-bnb rules: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#properties
- adda 404 page for the API
- add 'loading' state instead of just disabling the button: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#buttons-loading
- for admin panel in actions use: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#btn-groups-toolbar
- split up utils code into separate files
- consider lazy loading for components to reduce initial JS file size
