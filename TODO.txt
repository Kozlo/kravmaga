- center  the login page
- add util method for creating props with a dot for admin fields
- restyle the profile page
- add a create user button
- fix commits and users (wink wink)
- re-do user manage page
- re-do admin page
  - fix updating a user
  - add create user
  - add empty table for lessons (for demo)
- test if I need a 404 route for back-end (test with Postman)
- re-do the authentication according to Ronald's request
  - create the new functionality
  - add a default admin user script
  - make the necessary front-end changes
  - test the new code
- change the back-end code to make sure all ES6 types are used (e.g. import/export instead od require)
- replace all regular bootstrap with react-bootstrap and see if it can be removed completely
- switch to webpack and add hot module re-load
- create a 'lessons' section for the admin page
- add proper validation to form fields (need to figure out a general one)

- check if on logout the token also needs to be disabled (like request to back-end and auht0)
- check if there are no double dependencies and see if they can be removed (like bootstrap, so react-bootstrap is used only
- add filters and limits to user (and other lists)
- consider looping through the form control and creating them dynamically instead of having separate entries

- optionally add the PUT method as well, but make sure it works as expected
- Add JSDoc to components (research this a bit as well)

Bugs:
- when the user reloads the page and turns out he is blocked, 2 error messages are shown (from navbar and profile page requests)

Morten:
- move adminUserScript outside server folder
- use middleware for admin user
- user authentication middleware for all routes
- remove some checks and make mongoose catch them
- improve the config file if I leave it (prolly not)

-----------------------------------------------
Later
- add 'loading' state instead of just disabling the button: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#buttons-loading
- add a possibility in the API to select which fields to load (e.g. no need to get the hash and the salt and also _v for the user in the front-end)
- for admin panel in actions use: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#btn-groups-toolbar
- consider splitting up updatable user OR do object copying inside the action (pass a flag for user or admin OR user the existing is_admin)
- split up utils code into separate files
- consider https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-validation for validation
- add validation to forms (validation states, maybe disable buttons before a valid state has been reached etc.)
- consider renaming login to get token
  - maybe also consider some refresh token method (research this)
- research dependencies. maybe I don't nee both react and react-dom
- add a 'PUT' handler
- consider lazy loading for components to reduce initial JS file size
- should test routes for profile info, maybe need to logout user if authorization isn't fine on server,
- If the user is logging in with an unauthorized email (regardless of type - email/FB/GOOG), ask them to vertify the account first (indicate if it's email, FB, or GOOGLE)
- when done with phase 1, read on releases and make it a major release
