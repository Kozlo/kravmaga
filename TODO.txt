(DONE)- switch to using type Date, not string in the DB to be able to sort by date
(DONE)- don't allow the user to change the date from which he is a member (aka move member_from to 'admin_fields')
(DONE)- when a group is created, the list should be updated when creating a lesson
(DONE)- for lessons, also add 'end date/time'
(DONE)- password change changes
(DONE)- add gender field to user list
(DONE)- add proper validation to form fields (use react validate module)
(DONE)- implement some 'max length' (truncation) for user list fields (in case of a very long entry) (could be done together with general validation)
(DONE)- make it possible to add groups to users (not only vice versa)
(DONE)- fix cell sizes
- increase the max size of the page (so that everything fits)
- implement filters
- implement config (e.g. to limit how many results should be shown
- implement sorters
- restyle the profile page
- improve the layout for buttons (maybe create an 'actions' button that toggles a modal with all of the actions)
- make it possible to add/remove attendees from lessons directly
  - make sure the data ir reflected everywhere
- add user groups to table (if needed)
- switch to webpack and add hot module re-load
- when deleting/updating data (e.g. user) all dependable data should be updated as well (e.g. the user should be removed from all groups)
  - remove user from groups when he's deleted
  - remove attending lesson when a use is removed from a group
  - remove lessons when a group is deleted

- check if there are no double dependencies and see if they can be removed (like bootstrap, so react-bootstrap is used only
- add filters and limits to user (and other lists)
- consider looping through the form control and creating them dynamically instead of having separate entries

- optionally add the PUT method as well, but make sure it works as expected
- Add JSDoc to components (research this a bit as well)

Bugs:
(DONE)- Object.assign doesn't work on IE (should replce with jQuery)
- cannot create groups with a name that has the same starting letter as others
(DONE)- Object.assing doesn't work on IE
- when the user reloads the page and turns out he is blocked, 2 error messages are shown (from navbar and profile page requests)
  - maybe I can leave this
- for lessons, when creating one the start and end dates are checked correctly, but when updating and usein 'runValidators', they are not (at least I can set end date before start)
  - could be I need to add custom validation there

-----------------------------------------------
Later
- sort lessons by start date properly
- when saving a group for lesson, attendee for users etc... consider adding validation check where the entry's existence is checked (maybe not... need to consider)
- when deleting a user, should also remove his ID from groups and lessons
- research about auth0 and JWT, should the token be automatically refreshed after a while if the user is active?
- read on node.js/Express security and consider adding https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet
- add and use Node Security Project on the proejct https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/ ALDO snyk (checks and fixes issues in your codebase)
- limit how long input can be (e.g. no 100+ char long emails)
  - maybe check mongoose/mongodb defaults
- check what algo crypto is using and see if can be updated if SHA1 (unsecure)
- add CSRF protection: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- test and add brute force protection to authentication: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/
- add es-list rules, based on air-bnb rules: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#properties
- adda 404 page for the API
- add 'loading' state instead of just disabling the button: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#buttons-loading
- for admin panel in actions use: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#btn-groups-toolbar
- split up utils code into separate files
- research dependencies. maybe I don't nee both react and react-dom
- add a 'PUT' handler
- consider lazy loading for components to reduce initial JS file size
- when done with phase 1, read on releases and make it a major release
